# Laravel Migration Issue - Troubleshooting Summary

## Problem
When running 'php artisan migrate:fresh --seed', the following error occurs:
\\\
ErrorException: Array to string conversion
in vendor\laravel\framework\src\Illuminate\Database\Schema\Builder.php:163
\\\

## Root Cause Analysis
The error occurs in the Laravel core when the database schema builder attempts to convert a table name. 
This suggests there might be:
1. A corrupt configuration related to database connections
2. An issue with the SQLite database file
3. A custom service provider or package that's interfering with Laravel's database functionality

## Solutions Attempted
1. Fixed bootstrap/app.php file structure
2. Created a proper Exception Handler
3. Ensured the SQLite database file exists and is valid
4. Simplified database configuration
5. Disabled problematic service providers (ExcelCompatibilityServiceProvider)
6. Added missing configuration files for views

## Recommended Solution
Since the issue persists despite multiple fixes, consider one of these options:

1. Create a new Laravel project and migrate your code and database structure
\\\
composer create-project laravel/laravel new-project
// Then copy over migrations, models, controllers, etc.
\\\

2. Temporarily bypass migrations using raw SQL statements to create your database tables
\\\
// Create a PHP script that uses PDO to execute your table creation SQL directly
\\\

3. Investigate the exact version compatibility between Laravel and the packages used in your project

## Next Steps for Database Setup
1. For a quick solution, execute database/migrations/*.php files manually using raw SQL
2. For a more sustainable solution, create a new Laravel project and rebuild the database structure
